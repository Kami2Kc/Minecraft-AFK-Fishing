# Minecraft-AFK-Fishing


### Setup
#### =============================================

#### (This script is still quite basic and therefore not 100% accurate, but works just fine)

To setup this script you will need either a physical
cable or a software to imitate a cable (virtual cable) 
that will pass your computers audio output into input. 

If you have a audio jack / aux cable then connect it to the green port 
(headphone / output) on the back or front of your PC, next connect the other end
into the pink port (mic/input) which should be near the previous port (either front or back).

This software uses audio to work and therefore you will
need to have no other software outputing sound in the background (i.e. Spotify).

In game make sure to turn down all of the individual volume settings
except blocks, this will make sure only the sound of the fish and fishing rod
are picked up.

Before setting up the script make sure you are in a safe location where hostile mobs
wont spawn / get to you.

Finally start the script and tab back into your game, throw the line and the script should do the rest.

I advice that you dont throw the line too far and it might not get detected by the script from time to time, 
if you need to adjust the threshold then just change the value of THRESHOLD in the script.
